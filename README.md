Hello, welcome to my poorly written barely functional axion simulation project!

Lots of docstrings are not fully written out, these will be worked on slowly but surely, and (hopefully) the code will be optimised in the future.

The general implementation strategies are to:

1. Generate velocities from a velocity distribution of choice
2. Generate axion fields using these velocities OR use an inbuilt monte carlo method to simulate a bunch simultaneously
3. Your choice of visialisations and data interpretations

There are several kinds of inbuilt visualisation methods inside Banana itself (a surface plot (even an animated one!), quiver or vector field plot, 'theta' plots.
